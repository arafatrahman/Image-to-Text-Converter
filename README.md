# Image-to-Text-Converter
This project allows users to upload an image and extract text from it using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) powered by Tesseract.js, a popular JavaScript library. The extracted text can then be downloaded as a .txt file with a simple click.

# Features:
Image Upload: Upload images containing text (such as scanned documents, screenshots, or printed text).

# Text Extraction: Uses Tesseract.js to recognize and extract text from the uploaded image in real time.

# Progress Bar: Displays the progress of the OCR process, giving users feedback as the image is being processed.

# Download Text: Once the text is extracted, the user can download it as a .txt file with a click of a button.

# Browser-Side Processing: Everything is processed on the client side, so no server is required. It works entirely within the user's browser.

****How to Use:
Upload an image by clicking the Choose File button.

Click Extract Text to start the OCR process.

Watch the progress bar as the text is being extracted.

After the extraction is complete, click the Download Text button to save the text as a .txt file.
